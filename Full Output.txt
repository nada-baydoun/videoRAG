So polynomial space and non deterministic polynomial space are the same class. Basically, and that's extremely useful when you start to think about reconfiguration problems, because if you think of a reconfiguration problem where you're given some state and you want to reach the other one. So basically, you can solve that easily in non deterministic polynomial space.
